About UART((Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) AND KIT DE2

UART is a serial communication interface popular in embedded and microcontroller applications. The DE2 (DE2 Development and Education Board) is an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) development kit that uses the Altera (now Intel) Cyclone II chip, which is commonly used in embedded system education and development.

Usage:

Open the simulation tool and load the project files.

Simulate the provided testbenches or create your own test scenarios.

Analyze the simulation results to observe the behavior of the UART transmitter and receiver.

Modify the design files to experiment with different configurations or feat
